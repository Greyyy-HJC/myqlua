# 2024.1.23 note by Jinchen

## TODO NEXT

- Deal with the large MILC configs;
- Fix to Coulomb gauge and calculate the quark propagator.

## DONE

- Wrote my own gauge fixing module, check it at [mygfix](../module/jinchen/mygfix.qlua);
- Tried gauge fixing on the small test config for both Coulomb and Landau gauge, well behaved;
